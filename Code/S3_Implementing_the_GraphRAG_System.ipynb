Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away. Growth and Development The Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple\n",

Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2 The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Objective\n",
        "The goal of Stage 3 is to build a prototype system that integrates graph-based semantic retrieval with a large language model (LLM) to answer user questions using the structured 10-K knowledge graph created in Stage 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ Key Components and What Was Implemented\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **🔌 Neo4j Connection**\n",
        "   - Connected to the Neo4j AuraDB graph that contains `:Chunk` nodes from 10-K filings.\n",
        "   - Verified that all chunks were uploaded in Stage 2 and accessible via Cypher queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **🧠 Embedding & Vector Index**\n",
        "   - Used `OpenAI` to compute vector embeddings of each `Chunk.text`.\n",
        "   - Stored the embeddings in Neo4j under the `textEmbedding` property.\n",
        "   - Created a vector index (`form_10k_chunks`) on `:Chunk(textEmbedding)` for fast semantic search.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **🔍 Semantic Retrieval**\n",
        "   - Built a retrieval function using `Neo4jVector` to query top-k relevant chunks based on a user question.\n",
        "   - This enables semantic search — retrieving text that is *meaningfully similar*, not just keyword-matched.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **🤖 LLM Integration with LangChain**\n",
        "   - Connected OpenAI's GPT model via `ChatOpenAI` through the LangChain framework.\n",
        "   - Used `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to create a complete retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **🧪 Query Pipeline (Prototype)**\n",
        "   - Defined a `prettychain()` function to:\n",
        "     - Accept a user question\n",
        "     - Retrieve relevant graph chunks\n",
        "     - Generate and return a clear, context-aware answer\n",
        "   - This fulfills the end-to-end GraphRAG architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💬 Example Questions Supported by the System\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"What is Apple's primary business?\"\n",
        "- \"Where is Apple headquartered?\"\n",
        "- \"What are the top risks mentioned in Apple's 10-K?\"\n",
        "- \"Where are the primary suppliers for Apple?\"\n",
